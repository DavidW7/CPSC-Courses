Synchronize read ask the number from disk and wait for the disk to return value before it continues. Only one thing can be read at a time.
Since wait time is constant for each read, linear change in amount of numbers read will cause linear change in time taken.
Increase of blocks to read in multiple of 10 would also increase time taken in approximately multiple of 10.
