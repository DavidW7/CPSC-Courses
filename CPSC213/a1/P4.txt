I tested a few cases, and I have the code print output in hex as well (it printed in decimal in starter code and I didn't want to modify that):

Base case, no 1 in front: 
input: 
java Endianness 01 02 03 04
output:
big endian in hex: 1020304
little endian in hex: 4030201
Memory Contents
  Addr   Value
    0:   0x1
    1:   0x2
    2:   0x3
    3:   0x4
The big    endian integer value at address 0 is 16909060
The little endian integer value at address 0 is 67305985

Exception, not long enough: 
input: 
java Endianness 01 02 03
output:
usage: java Endianness n0 n1 n2 n3
where: n0..n3 are byte values in memory at addresses 0..3 respectively, in hex (no 0x).

Exception, not number:
input: 
java Endianness gf 01 02 03
output:
usage: java Endianness n0 n1 n2 n3
where: n0..n3 are byte values in memory at addresses 0..3 respectively, in hex (no 0x).

Should take only first 4 values: 
input: 
java Endianness 01 02 03 04 05
output:
big endian in hex: 1020304
little endian in hex: 4030201

The little endian integer value at address 0 is 67305985

Some 1 in front: 
input: 
java Endianness fe 01 fa 04

The little endian integer value at address 0 is 83493374

All 1 in front:

java Endianness fa 8b a1 b4

The little endian integer value at address 0 is -1264481286

Palindrome:
