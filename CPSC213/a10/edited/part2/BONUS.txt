In my answer, semaphore implementation end up having people lost place than mutex conditions. It's approximately 200 wait vs 70 wait. It's likely because semaphores run faster so people are able to iterate going in and out of well faster. People who wait end up waiting for more people because those people can go in and out in less time. When I time the implementations with the same MAX_OCCUPANCY, NUM_ITERATIONS, NUM_PEOPLE, FAIR_WAITING_COUNT, semaphore had 0.373s runtime vs 0.977s runtime for mutex condition, so that kinda confirms my suspicion.
