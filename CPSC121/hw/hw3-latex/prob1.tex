\item[9] Consider the following sets and predicates: 
  \begin{itemize}
  \item $D$: video game developers
  \item $G$: video game titles
  \item $P$: hardware platforms
  \item $M(d, g)$: developer $d$ made game $g$.
  \item $R(g, p)$: game $g$ released on platform $p$.
  \item $B(d, g)$: developer $d$ bribed a journalist to write a favourable review for game $g$.
  \end{itemize}

  Rewrite each of  the following statements using \textbf{only}  the quantifiers $\forall$
  and $\exists$, the predicates $M$, $R$ and $B$, the domains $D$, $G$, $P$, and $\mathbb{R}$ (the set of real numbers),
  logical connectives, and the operators $=$, $\neq$. $<$, $\le$, $\ge$ and $>$.
  
  If you feel a  sentence is ambiguous, then state your assumed interpretation.
