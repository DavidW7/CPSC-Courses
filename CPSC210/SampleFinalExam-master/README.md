Note: the questions in `SampleFinal` document do not constitute an actual final exam - t. They are provided to you to give you some indication of the **kinds** of questions that could be asked. However, there are other kinds of questions that could be asked and other	
topics that could be covered. You should therefore not use these sample questiond as	your primary source of study material. You should also review the sample questions from the midterm exams, given that the final wil be comprehensive.

* Please also keep in mind that while you will be accessing the corresponding Java applications using your computer, you will not have access to a computer during your exam. When answering questions, you should do so assuming that the code was presented to you on paper. 

* Final exam is 2.5 hours long; you are going to be writing a lot of code, on paper! Please prepare yourself for that.
