# Fit Life Gym Kiosk

Imagine you've just walked into a gym. You want more information about the gym before you sign up, but all of the front desk staff are busy with other members. Lucky for you,Â this gym has automated front desk kiosks. These kiosks can display information about the gym and activate new memberships. Cool!
