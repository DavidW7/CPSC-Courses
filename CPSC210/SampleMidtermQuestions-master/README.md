Note: the questions in `MidtermSample` document do not constitute an actual midterm exam - there are more questions presented here than will appear on a single exam. However, many of the questions are taken from actual midterm exams and are therefore representative of the kinds of questions that could be asked. 

* Please keep in mind that this set of questions does not exhaust all the possibilities and therefore should not be used as your primary source of study material. 

* Please also keep in mind that while you will be accessing the corresponding Java applications using your computer, you will not have access to a computer during your exam. When answering questions, you should do so assuming that the code was presented to you on paper. 

* Do not use IntelliJ's code-navigation tools to help you extract models from code (e.g. sequence diagrams and call graphs) and do not use IntelliJ to help you write code.
